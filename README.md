# TomatoMamba: Exploring the use of State Space Models for Efficient Tomato Leaf Disease Detection and Classification.

This repository contains the code for the paper TomatoMamba: Exploring the use of State Space Models for Efficient Tomato Leaf Disease Detection and Classification.

## Overview

TomatoMamba is a state-of-the-art framework for classifying tomato leaf diseases using a state space model. This repository provides the implementation details and the necessary scripts to reproduce the results presented in the paper.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, please use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Demo

To run the model, use the following command:

```bash
python simple_tomatomamba.py
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is PlantVillage Dataset.
